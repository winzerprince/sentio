# SVR vs XGBoost Model Comparison Analysis

**Date:** September 16, 2025  
**Analysis:** Side-by-side prediction comparison of SVR and XGBoost models on 10 sample tracks

## Executive Summary

The comparison confirms that **SVR and XGBoost make meaningfully different predictions**, with SVR showing superior performance on arousal prediction (R²=0.567 vs 0.562). The models show substantial disagreement on individual predictions, with average differences of ~0.33 points on both dimensions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Prediction Differences
- **Average Valence Difference:** 0.325 points (on 1-9 scale)
- **Average Arousal Difference:** 0.335 points (on 1-9 scale)
- **Maximum Differences:** 0.795 (Valence), 0.864 (Arousal)

### 2. Model Agreement Patterns
- **High Agreement:** Samples 2, 1874 - both models agree on emotional interpretation
- **Disagreement:** Sample 550 - SVR classified as "negative emotion, high energy" vs XGBoost "neutral emotion, high energy"

### 3. Performance Context
- **SVR Arousal Advantage:** R²=0.567 (better)
- **XGBoost Overall:** R²=0.540 (general performance)
- **Practical Impact:** Differences large enough to change emotional interpretation in some cases

## Detailed Sample Analysis

| Sample | SVR Valence | XGB Valence | SVR Arousal | XGB Arousal | Agreement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2      | 3.537       | 4.331       | 4.534       | 4.160       | ✓ Both negative, low energy |
| 1874   | 4.926       | 5.132       | 5.787       | 5.759       | ✓ Both neutral, high energy |
| 550    | 4.559       | 5.300       | 5.854       | 5.883       | ✗ SVR=negative, XGB=neutral |
| 325    | 5.131       | 5.293       | 5.031       | 5.895       | ✓ Both neutral emotions |
| 715    | 3.534       | 3.848       | 4.373       | 4.063       | ✓ Both negative, low energy |

## Model Selection Recommendations

### Use SVR When:
- **Arousal prediction is critical** (R²=0.567 > XGBoost 0.562)
- **Energy-based music applications** (workout playlists, sleep music)
- **Interpretability is important** (simpler model structure)

### Use XGBoost When:
- **Overall balanced performance needed** (R²=0.540 overall)
- **Feature importance analysis required** (built-in importance scores)
- **Handling complex feature interactions** (tree-based advantages)

### Ensemble Approach:
Consider combining both models:
- Use SVR for arousal predictions
- Use XGBoost for valence predictions
- Average predictions for robustness

## Technical Notes

### Prediction Scale
- All predictions on original [1,9] scale from training
- Convert to [-1,1] using: `(prediction - 5) / 4`
- Interpretation thresholds: <4.5 (negative), 4.5-5.5 (neutral), >5.5 (positive)

### Feature Processing
- Both models use identical 164-dimensional feature vectors
- Features: mean, std, min, max aggregations of audio features
- StandardScaler applied consistently across both models

## Future Work

1. **Expand Sample Size:** Test on larger validation set for statistical significance
2. **Correlation Analysis:** Examine where models agree/disagree most
3. **Ensemble Methods:** Implement weighted combination based on dimension-specific performance
4. **Cross-Validation:** Validate arousal superiority across different data splits
