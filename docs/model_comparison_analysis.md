## Model Selection Recommendations

### Use SVR When:
- **Arousal prediction is critical** (R²=0.567 > XGBoost 0.562)
- **Energy-based music applications** (workout playlists, sleep music)
- **Interpretability is important** (simpler model structure)

### Use XGBoost When:
- **Overall balanced performance needed** (R²=0.540 overall)
- **Feature importance analysis required** (built-in importance scores)
- **Handling complex feature interactions** (tree-based advantages)

### Ensemble Approach:
Consider combining both models:
- Use SVR for arousal predictions
- Use XGBoost for valence predictions
- Average predictions for robustness

## Technical Notes

### Prediction Scale
- All predictions on original [1,9] scale from training
- Convert to [-1,1] using: `(prediction - 5) / 4`
- Interpretation thresholds: <4.5 (negative), 4.5-5.5 (neutral), >5.5 (positive)

### Feature Processing
- Both models use identical 164-dimensional feature vectors
- Features: mean, std, min, max aggregations of audio features
- StandardScaler applied consistently across both models

## Model Performance Analysis

### Why SVR Outperforms XGBoost for Arousal Prediction

1. **Kernel Advantage for Continuous Features:**
   - SVR's RBF kernel effectively captures the non-linear relationships in spectral and temporal audio features that strongly correlate with arousal.
   - The continuous nature of arousal (energy level in music) maps well to SVR's ability to model smooth transitions in feature space.

2. **Regularization Benefits:**
   - SVR's C parameter provides effective regularization that prevents overfitting to noise in the training data.
   - Arousal features (energy, tempo, rhythm patterns) benefit from this regularized approach as they contain more consistent patterns across genres.

3. **Robust to Outliers:**
   - SVR's epsilon-insensitive loss function makes it more robust to outliers in arousal annotations.
   - Arousal ratings tend to have higher inter-annotator agreement but occasional outliers that SVR handles effectively.

4. **Feature Interaction Handling:**
   - While XGBoost excels at complex feature interactions, arousal prediction depe
