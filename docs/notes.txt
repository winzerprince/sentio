INTRODUCTION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - COMPREHENSIVE STUDY NOTES

MODULE 1: Artificial Intelligence: History, Trends and Future

Key Definitions and Concepts

Artificial Intelligence Definition:

AI is the field devoted to building artifacts capable of displaying behaviors we consider intelligent
It involves creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence
Dimensions of AI:

Thinking vs. Acting: How AI systems process vs. what they do
Human-like vs. Rational: Mimicking humans vs. optimal decision-making
Weak vs. Strong AI:
Weak AI: Building machines that act intelligently (current focus)
Strong AI: Building actual "persons" with consciousness
Historical Development

Early Dreams and Concepts:

Leonardo Da Vinci (1495): Designed humanoid robot as medieval knight
Frank Baum (1900): Created beloved robot in "Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
Alan Turing: Published landmark paper on machines with true intelligence
Key Historical Insight:

First 30 years of AI research revealed: Intelligence requires knowledge
Intelligent Behavior Characteristics

Problem-solving capability
Learning from experience
Adapting to new situations
Using knowledge effectively
Making rational decisions
AI vs. Conventional Computing

Conventional Computing:

Follows predetermined algorithms
Processes data mechanically
Limited adaptability
AI Computing:

Uses heuristics and reasoning
Learns and adapts
Handles uncertainty
Makes inferences
Problem-Solving Framework

To build an AI system for any problem:

Define the problem precisely
Analyze the problem thoroughly
Isolate and represent task knowledge
Choose the best problem-solving techniques
MODULE 2: Problem Solving in Artificial Intelligence

Heuristic Functions

Definition:

A heuristic is a function that estimates how close a state is to a goal
Takes current state and returns estimated distance to goal state
Purpose:

Speed up exhaustive, blind searches (depth-first, breadth-first)
Provide "educated guesses" about promising paths
Creating Heuristics: Problem Relaxation

Standard Approach:

Start with original problem
Remove or relax some constraints
Solve the relaxed problem optimally
Use this solution as heuristic for original problem
Result: Heuristics from relaxed problems are usually admissible

Admissible vs. Inadmissible Heuristics

Admissible Heuristic:

Never overestimates the cost to reach goal
Never returns value greater than actual cost
Guarantees optimal solutions
Inadmissible Heuristic:

May overestimate costs
Faster but may miss optimal solutions
Trade-offs in Heuristics

Quality vs. Speed: More accurate heuristics take more computation time
Composite Heuristics: Combine multiple heuristics for better accuracy
Search Strategies

Best-First Search:

Combines advantages of depth-first and breadth-first
Uses heuristic to guide search direction
Hill Climbing:

Always moves to better neighboring state
Drawbacks:
Local Maxima: Gets stuck at peaks that aren't global optimum
Plateaus: Flat areas with no improvement direction
Ridges: Narrow peaks difficult to navigate
Incompleteness: May never find solution due to local maxima
MODULE 3: Problem Solving by Search

AND-OR Graphs

Definition:

Represent problems solvable by decomposition into smaller subproblems
All subproblems must be solved (AND relationship)
Alternative solution paths (OR relationship)
Characteristics:

Defined as hypergraphs
Solution graph analogous to path in ordinary graph
Use staged search strategy
Game Theory in AI

Why Games Matter:

Well-defined environment with discrete states
Focus purely on decision-making strategy
Clear rules and measurable success/failure
Excellent testing ground for AI algorithms
Game Trees:

Layered tree structure
Alternating levels for different players
Each level represents one player's turn to move
Minimax Algorithm

Purpose:

Find optimal strategy in two-player, zero-sum games
Determine best move for MAX player
How it Works:

MAX player tries to maximize payoff
MIN player tries to minimize MAX's payoff
Algorithm works backward from terminal states
Assumes both players play optimally
Minimax Value:

Value of position assuming optimal play by both sides
MAX chooses move leading to highest minimax value
Alpha-Beta Pruning

Purpose:

Reduce computation time for minimax
Eliminate branches that won't affect final decision
How it Works:

Alpha (Œ±): Best value MAX can guarantee so far
Beta (Œ≤): Best value MIN can guarantee so far
Prune branch when Œ± ‚â• Œ≤
Benefit: Can reduce computation by huge factor without losing accuracy

MODULE 4: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

Knowledge Representation Fundamentals

Knowledge Hierarchy:

Data: Raw facts
Information: Processed data
Knowledge: Information with context and understanding
Knowledge Representation Hypothesis:

Any intelligent system must represent knowledge explicitly
Manipulation of knowledge representations enables intelligent behavior
Symbolic vs. Connectionist AI

Symbolic AI:

Uses symbols and rules to represent knowledge
Logic-based reasoning
Explicit representation of concepts
Connectionist AI:

Neural network-based approaches
Distributed representation
Learning through connection weights
Physical Symbol System Hypothesis

Intelligence can be achieved through manipulation of symbol structures
Symbols can represent any aspect of human knowledge
Symbol manipulation can produce intelligent behavior
Knowledge Representation Features

Three Levels:

Epistemological Level: What knowledge is represented
Logical Level: How knowledge is structured logically
Implementation Level: How it's implemented in computer
Propositional Logic

Definition:

Formal language with precisely defined syntax and semantics
Uses propositions (true/false statements)
Connected by logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES)
Components:

Propositions: Basic statements that are true or false
Variables: Symbols representing propositions
Operators: Logical connectives between propositions
MODULE 5: First Order Logic

Declarative Semantics

Conceptualization:

Triple consisting of:
Universe of discourse (domain objects)
Functional basis set (functions over domain)
Relational basis set (relations between objects)
Formalization Process:

Start with conceptualization of domain
Create formal language to express facts
Write sentences believed to be true
Ensure sentences are satisfied by intended interpretation
Truth and Satisfiability

Satisfaction:

Relative notion of truth
Sentence is satisfied if true under given interpretation
Depends on logical operators and quantifiers
Universal Quantification (‚àÄ):

Sentence satisfied if enclosed statement true for ALL variable assignments
"For all x, P(x)" means P(x) true for every x in domain
Existential Quantification (‚àÉ):

Sentence satisfied if enclosed statement true for SOME variable assignments
"There exists x such that P(x)" means P(x) true for at least one x
Axioms and Theorems

Axioms:

Facts and rules capturing important domain knowledge
Assumed to be true without proof
Foundation for deriving other truths
Theorems:

Well-formed formulas provable from axioms
Derived through logical inference rules
Extend knowledge beyond basic axioms
Inference Rules:

Systematic methods for deriving new knowledge
Based on logical principles
Enable reasoning from premises to conclusions
MODULE 6: Inference in First Order Logic

Resolution Principle

Definition:

Important rule of inference applicable to clauses
Used to demonstrate unsatisfiability
Foundation for automated theorem proving
Resolution Process:

Convert formulas to clause form
Apply resolution rule to derive new clauses
Continue until contradiction found or no new clauses
Resolution Trace:

Sequence of annotated clauses
Organized into levels
Shows derivation path
Soundness and Completeness

Soundness:

Any clause derived using resolution is logically implied by database
Resolution never derives false conclusions from true premises
Completeness:

If something is logically implied, resolution will eventually derive it
May require paramodulation for equality handling
Answer Extraction

Process:

Modify resolution to not just prove theorems but extract answers
Use answer literals in clauses
Final proof provides specific answer to query
Challenge:

Resolution alone doesn't provide general effective solution
Need additional strategies for practical reasoning
Unification

Most General Unifier (MGU):

Preserves maximum generality when matching formulas
Leaves maximum flexibility for future resolutions
Essential for keeping search space manageable
Computational Strategies:

Breadth-first: Complete but grossly inefficient
Depth-first: More efficient but may be incomplete
Best-first: Uses heuristics to guide search
MODULE 7: Reasoning Under Uncertainty

Probability and Utility Theory

Decision Theory Components:

Probability Theory: Handles uncertainty about facts
Utility Theory: Weighs desirability of outcomes
Combined: Enables rational decision-making under uncertainty
Sources of Uncertainty

Why Uncertainty Arises:

Laziness: Too much work to determine exact truth
Theoretical Ignorance: No complete theory available
Practical Ignorance: Even with theory, can't determine exact values
First-Order Logic Limitations:

Assumes complete knowledge
Cannot handle degrees of belief
Fails in complex, uncertain domains
Basic Probability Concepts

Random Variables:

Discrete: Finite number of possible values
Continuous: Infinite number of possible values
Probability Axioms:

Probabilities between 0 and 1
Probability of certain event = 1
Probabilities of mutually exclusive events sum to 1
Bayesian Networks

Purpose:

Represent knowledge in uncertain domains
