**Project:** Sentio - AI Music Generation Based on Emotion  
**Phase:** Emotion Classification and Analysis Models

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of our emotion prediction models developed as part of the Sentio project. We successfully implemented and evaluated three machine learning approaches for predicting musical emotions from audio features: Linear/Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XGBoost. Our analysis focused on static emotion prediction models rather than generative models due to computational constraints and the need to establish a solid foundation for emotion understanding before moving to music generation.

**Key Findings:**
- XGBoost achieved the best overall performance with an average R² score of 0.540
- SVR performed best for arousal prediction (R² = 0.567)
- Feature scaling was critical for SVR and Ridge regression performance
- Annotation scaling from [1,9] to [-1,1] improved model convergence and interpretability

## 1. Introduction and Project Scope

### 1.1 Why Analysis Models Before Generation Models?

The decision to focus on emotion analysis models rather than immediately pursuing generative models was driven by several critical factors:

#### **Computational Resource Constraints**
Generative models, particularly those capable of producing high-quality audio (such as Variational Autoencoders, GANs, or modern diffusion models), require:
- **Extensive computational power**: Training generative audio models typically requires powerful GPUs for weeks or months
- **Large memory footprint**: Audio generation models often need substantial RAM and VRAM to handle high-dimensional audio representations
- **Massive datasets**: Effective generative models require thousands of hours of labeled audio data
- **Storage requirements**: Audio datasets are significantly larger than feature-based datasets

#### **Foundation Building Strategy**
Before generating music based on emotions, we need to:
- **Understand the emotion-audio relationship**: Analysis models help us identify which audio features most strongly correlate with specific emotions
- **Validate our approach**: Establishing that we can accurately predict emotions from audio features validates our overall methodology
- **Feature importance discovery**: Understanding which features matter most for emotion prediction informs better generative model design
- **Baseline establishment**: Analysis models provide performance baselines for evaluating future generative approaches

#### **Incremental Development Philosophy**
Following established machine learning best practices:
- **Start simple, then complexify**: Begin with interpretable models before moving to black-box approaches
- **Validate assumptions**: Ensure our emotional annotation scaling and feature extraction approaches are sound
- **Risk mitigation**: Identify and resolve data preprocessing issues before investing in expensive generative model training

### 1.2 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis phase were to:
1. Develop robust emotion prediction models using traditional machine learning approaches
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms for music emotion recognition
3. Understand the relationship between audio features and emotional perception
4. Establish preprocessing pipelines and evaluation frameworks for future generative work
5. Identify the most predictive audio features for emotion recognition

## 2. Methodology and Model Selection

### 2.1 Model Selection Rationale

We selected three distinct machine learning approaches to provide comprehensive coverage of different algorithmic philosophies:

#### **Linear/Ridge Regression**
- **Purpose**: Baseline model and interpretability benchmark
- **Strengths**: 
  - Highly interpretable coefficients
  - Fast training and prediction
  - Robust to overfitting with proper regularization
  - Provides clear feature importance insights
- **Use Case**: Understanding linear relationships between audio features and emotions

#### **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Purpose**: Capturing non-linear relationships with kernel methods
- **Strengths**:
  - Excellent performance on high-dimensional data
  - Kernel trick enables complex non-linear mappings
  - Robust to outliers through support vector mechanism
  - Strong theoretical foundation
- **Use Case**: Modeling complex, non-linear emotion-feature relationships

#### **XGBoost Regression**
- **Purpose**: State-of-the-art ensemble method for tabular data
- **Strengths**:
  - Excellent performance on structured/tabular data
  - Built-in feature importance analysis
  - Handles missing values and outliers naturally
  - Gradient boosting captures complex interactions
  - Regularization prevents overfitting
- **Use Case**: Maximum predictive performance with interpretability

### 2.2 Why These Three Models?

This combination provides:
- **Algorithmic diversity**: Linear (Ridge), kernel-based (SVR), and ensemble (XGBoost) approaches
- **Complexity spectrum**: From simple linear relationships to complex non-linear interactions
- **Interpretability range**: From highly interpretable (Ridge) to moderately interpretable (XGBoost)
- **Performance benchmarking**: Allows comparison across different machine learning paradigms

## 3. Data Preprocessing and Scaling Decisions

### 3.1 Annotation Scaling: From [1,9] to [-1,1]

One of the most critical preprocessing decisions involved rescaling the emotion annotations from their original [1,9] range to [-1,1].

#### **Original Data Characteristics**
The DEAM dataset provides annotations on a 1-9 scale where:
- **Valence**: 1 = very negative, 9 = very positive emotions
- **Arousal**: 1 = very calm/relaxed, 9 = very excited/energetic

#### **Rationale for Rescaling**

**1. Mathematical Optimization Benefits:**
- **Gradient descent convergence**: Neural networks and gradient-based optimizers converge faster with zero-centered data
- **Numerical stability**: Smaller ranges reduce the risk of numerical overflow/underflow
- **Weight initialization**: Standard initialization schemes assume approximately zero-centered inputs

**2. Model Performance Considerations:**
- **SVR kernel effectiveness**: RBF kernels work better with normalized data ranges
- **Ridge regression regularization**: L2 regularization is more effective when features are on similar scales
- **Distance-based algorithms**: SVR relies on distance calculations that benefit from normalized ranges

**3. Psychological Interpretation:**
- **Neutral point emphasis**: The [-1,1] scale makes 0 a clear neutral point, which aligns with psychological theories of emotion
- **Symmetry**: Positive and negative emotions are given equal representational space
- **Interpretability**: Model predictions become more intuitive (negative = negative emotion, positive = positive emotion)

#### **Scaling Formula Applied**
```
scaled_value = ((original_value - 1) / (9 - 1)) * 2 - 1
scaled_value = ((original_value - 1) / 8) * 2 - 1
```

This transformation ensures:
- Original value 1 → Scaled value -1 (most negative/calm)
- Original value 5 → Scaled value 0 (neutral)
- Original value 9 → Scaled value 1 (most positive/excited)

### 3.2 Feature Scaling: StandardScaler Implementation

#### **Why Feature Scaling Was Critical**

**Impact on Different Models:**

**1. Support Vector Regression (Most Affected):**
- SVR uses distance calculations in high-dimensional space
- Features with larger scales (e.g., spectral features vs. temporal features) can dominate the kernel calculations
- Without scaling, features with large numerical ranges effectively "mask" smaller-scale but potentially important features
- RBF kernel parameter γ becomes difficult to tune across different feature scales

**2. Ridge Regression (Significantly Affected):**
- L2 regularization penalizes large coefficients
- Features with larger scales receive disproportionately smaller coefficients to maintain the same regularization penalty
- This can lead to incorrect feature importance assessments
- Cross-validation for α (regularization strength) becomes less effective

**3. XGBoost (Least Affected):**
- Tree-based algorithms are inherently scale-invariant for splitting decisions
- Uses feature thresholds rather than distance calculations
- However, regularization terms still benefit from normalized features
- Feature importance calculations remain consistent regardless of scale

#### **Evidence of Scaling Impact**

Our experiments demonstrated:
- **SVR performance improvement**: ~15-20% improvement in R² scores after proper scaling
- **Ridge regression stability**: More consistent cross-validation results and hyperparameter selection
- **XGBoost consistency**: Minimal performance change but improved feature importance interpretability

### 3.3 Train-Test Split and Data Leakage Prevention

**Critical Implementation Detail:**
```python
# Correct approach - split BEFORE scaling
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale based on training data only
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)  # Use training statistics
```

This approach prevents data leakage by ensuring test set statistics don't influence the scaling parameters.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics and Their Appropriateness

### 6.1 Selected Metrics Rationale

We employed four complementary metrics to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework:

#### **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**
**Why chosen:**
- **Interpretability**: Directly interpretable as percentage of variance explained
- **Scale-independent**: Allows comparison across different emotion dimensions
- **Standard benchmark**: Widely used in regression literature for comparison with other studies

**Interpretation in our context:**
- R² = 0.540 means our best model explains 54% of the variance in emotion ratings
- Remaining 46% represents inherent subjectivity in human emotion perception
- Values >0.5 are considered good for emotion prediction tasks

#### **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**
**Why chosen:**
- **Units preservation**: Results in same units as original predictions (scaled emotion values)
- **Outlier sensitivity**: Heavily penalizes large prediction errors
- **Optimization alignment**: Many models optimize MSE-based loss functions

**Interpretation in our context:**
- RMSE ≈ 0.82 on [-1,1] scale represents average error of ~0.82 emotion units
- Considering the scale, this represents reasonable prediction accuracy
- Lower RMSE indicates more precise predictions

#### **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
**Why chosen:**
- **Robust to outliers**: Less sensitive to extreme prediction errors than RMSE
- **Interpretable**: Average absolute prediction error
- **Complementary**: Provides different perspective than RMSE

**Interpretation in our context:**
- MAE ≈ 0.66 indicates average absolute error of 0.66 emotion units
- More robust metric for overall model performance assessment
- Lower values indicate more consistent predictions

#### **MSE (Mean Square Error)**
**Why chosen:**
