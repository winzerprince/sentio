CSC2101 – Artificial Intelligence
Assignment Task: Weeks 3 & 4
Group Discussions – Individual Submissions
(1) Task Overview
For Weeks 3 and 4, you must complete the Diploma in Fundamentals of Artificial
Intelligence (NPTEL) on Alison and use it to strengthen your understanding of AI
foundations. Here is the course: https://alison.com/course/diploma-in-fundamentals-
of-artificial-intelligence
Beyond summarizing the modules, you must trace connections between the Alison course
content and the following areas already studied in class:
• Data Mining (classification, clustering, association, anomaly detection).
• Howard Gardner’s 8 Types of Intelligence (e.g., linguistic, logical-
mathematical, spatial, etc.).
• Computational AI Philosophies (Strong vs Weak AI, Turing Test, Chinese Room,
Frame Problem, Simulation Argument, Connectionism vs Classical theories).
Your outputs must show evidence of integration: do not only summarize Alison modules
but also link them with prior concepts and your team project context.
You must:
1. Complete the Alison course and obtain the certificate.
2. Post the certificate on your LinkedIn profile.
3. Prepare a detailed PowerPoint slide deck covering all course modules.
4. Record a video presentation explaining your slides.
5. Submit the certificate, slides, and YouTube link through the Google Form
provided.
Although you are expected to discuss course concepts in your groups, all outputs must
be completed and submitted individually.
(2) Instructions
A. Alison Certificate
1. Create your Alison account and enroll in the course:
Diploma in Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence.
2. Complete all modules and assessments.
3. Download the official Alison Certificate.
4. Post the certificate on LinkedIn with a professional reflection (2–3
sentences) connecting the course to your project.
5. Capture a screenshot of the LinkedIn post.
6. Upload both the certificate PDF and LinkedIn proof during submission:

B. PowerPoint Slide Deck
You must prepare a slide deck covering all course modules. For each module, create
four slides:
• Slides 1–3: Summarize the key concepts clearly, using bullet points, diagrams,
or examples.
• Slide 4: Relate the module’s concepts explicitly to your team project.
The modules to be covered are:
1. Artificial Intelligence: History, Trends, and Future – explain AI’s origins,
milestones, current trends, and future predictions. Application: locate your project
in this trajectory (e.g., AI for Ugandan agriculture or healthcare).
• Data Mining: Show how historical shifts (symbolic → statistical → deep
learning) mirror the evolution of data mining from rule-based systems to
predictive models.
• Types of Intelligence: Link to logical-mathematical intelligence (reasoning
across milestones) and linguistic intelligence (AI’s rise in NLP).
• Philosophy: Reflect on Strong vs Weak AI debates in shaping the “future of AI”
narrative.
• Project Example: “In our agricultural disease detection project, we situate
our solution within the trend of moving from expert systems to ML-based
detection.”
2. Introduction to Problem Solving in AI – define problems in terms of states,
operators, and goals. Application: frame your dataset and objectives as problem
states.
• Data Mining: Show how classification problems can be reframed as state-space
search (e.g., classifying patient symptoms).
• Types of Intelligence: Connect to logical-mathematical intelligence
(structuring problems formally).
• Philosophy: Raise the Frame Problem — can AI know which aspects of a problem
state are relevant?
• Project Example: “In our chatbot, defining a problem as ‘initial state =
symptoms’ and ‘goal state = likely diagnosis’ makes reasoning transparent.”
3. Problem Solving by Search – present uninformed and informed search methods (DFS,
BFS, A*, heuristics). Application: link to diagnosis, resource allocation, or
optimization in your project.
• Data Mining: Highlight how clustering can reduce search complexity by grouping
states.
• Types of Intelligence: Connect to spatial intelligence (navigating search
trees).
• Philosophy: Relate to simulation argument — is the search tree itself a
“simulation” of possibilities?
• Project Example: “Our maternal health assistant uses heuristic search to
prioritize safer treatment options more quickly.”
4. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (Overview + FOL) – explain symbolic
representations and FOL rules. Application: show how your project encodes rules or
relationships.
• Data Mining: Association rules → transformed into FOL expressions.
• Types of Intelligence: Connect to linguistic intelligence (expressing rules)
and intrapersonal intelligence (self-reflective rules).
• Philosophy: Consider limits of formalization — can all knowledge be captured
symbolically?
• Project Example: “Our smart irrigation project encodes knowledge such as: ‘IF
soil moisture < 30% AND rainfall probability < 20%, THEN irrigate.’”
