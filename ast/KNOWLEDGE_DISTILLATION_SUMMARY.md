---

### 2. **Knowledge Distillation Loss** (New Cell)

**Purpose:** Train student to mimic teacher using multiple learning signals

**Distillation Methods Implemented:**

#### a) Response-Based Distillation (50% weight)
- Student learns to match teacher's emotion predictions
- Uses both hard targets (ground truth) and soft targets (teacher outputs)
- Temperature scaling (T=4.0) for smoother distributions

#### b) Feature-Based Distillation (30% weight)
- Student learns intermediate representations from teacher
- Extracts features from transformer blocks
- Normalizes and matches feature distributions

#### c) Attention Transfer (20% weight)
- Student learns where teacher "looks" in the input
- Matches attention weight distributions across layers
- Helps student focus on important spectrogram regions

**Loss Formula:**
```
L_total = α·L_response + β·L_feature + γ·L_attention

where:
- α = 0.5 (response)
- β = 0.3 (features)
- γ = 0.2 (attention)
```

**Code Location:** Cell with `class KnowledgeDistillationLoss`

---

### 3. **Distillation Training Loop** (New Cell)

**Purpose:** Train student model using the teacher as a guide

**Training Configuration:**
- **Epochs:** 20 with early stopping
- **Learning Rate:** 2e-4 with cosine annealing
- **Scheduler:** Warm restarts every 5 epochs
- **Patience:** 5 epochs for early stopping
- **Gradient Clipping:** Max norm of 1.0

**Training Process:**
1. Freeze teacher model (no gradient updates)
2. For each batch:
   - Get teacher predictions (no gradients)
   - Get student predictions (with gradients)
   - Extract features and attention from both
   - Calculate distillation loss
   - Update only student weights

**Features:**
- Real-time monitoring of all loss components
- Side-by-side evaluation of teacher vs student
- Automatic model checkpointing
- Early stopping based on validation CCC

**Code Location:** Cell with `def train_distillation_epoch`

- **Android:** 8.0+ (API Level 26+)
- **PyTorch Mobile:** 1.13 or higher
- **Storage:** 100MB for model + cache

### Integration Steps

#### 1. Add Dependencies (build.gradle)

}
```

#### 2. Load Model
```java
Module model = Module.load(assetFilePath("mobile_vit_emotion_model.pt"));
```

#### 3. Preprocess Input
```java
// Convert mel-spectrogram to 224x224x3 tensor
// Apply ImageNet normalization
float[] mean = {0.485f, 0.456f, 0.406f};
float[] std = {0.229f, 0.224f, 0.225f};
```

#### 4. Run Inference
```java
Tensor inputTensor = Tensor.fromBlob(input, new long[]{1, 3, 224, 224});
Tensor outputTensor = model.forward(IValue.from(inputTensor)).toTensor();
float[] emotions = outputTensor.getDataAsFloatArray();

## 🔬 Distillation Method: Why This Approach?

### Why Not Simple MSE Loss?
Simple output matching loses information. Our approach captures:
1. **What** the teacher predicts (response distillation)
2. **How** the teacher thinks (feature distillation)
3. **Where** the teacher looks (attention transfer)

### Why Temperature Scaling?
Temperature (T=4.0) makes probability distributions "softer":
- Reveals model uncertainty
- Transfers dark knowledge (low-probability classes)
- Better generalization

### Why Multiple Loss Components?
Different aspects of knowledge:
- **Response:** Final decision-making
- **Features:** Intermediate representations
- **Attention:** Input importance weighting

### Comparison with Other Methods

| Method | Size Reduction | Speed | Accuracy Retention |
|--------|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Pruning** | 2-3x | 1.5x | 85-90% |
| **Quantization** | 2-4x | 2x | 92-95% |
| **Knowledge Distillation** | **10-15x** | **4x** | **90-95%** ✅ |
| **Neural Architecture Search** | 5-10x | 3x | 88-93% |

**Our choice wins on:** Maximum compression with minimal accuracy loss

---

## 🧪 Validation & Testing

### Code Coherence Checks Implemented

#### 1. **Shape Validation**
```python
# Verify input/output shapes match
assert test_input.shape == (batch_size, 3, 224, 224)
assert test_output.shape == (batch_size, 2)
```

#### 2. **Gradient Flow Test**
```python
# Ensure student receives gradients, teacher doesn't
assert any(p.grad is not None for p in student.parameters())
assert all(p.grad is None for p in teacher.parameters())
```

#### 3. **Output Range Validation**
```python
# Emotions should be in [-1, 1] due to Tanh
assert -1 <= test_output.min() <= test_output.max() <= 1
```

#### 4. **TorchScript Verification**
```python
# Verify exported model matches original
max_diff = torch.max(torch.abs(original_output - scripted_output))
assert max_diff < 1e-5  # Numerical precision tolerance
```

#### 5. **Loss Component Validation**
```python
# All loss components should be positive
assert all(v >= 0 for v in loss_dict.values())
```

#### Issue: TorchScript export fails
**Solutions:**
- Use torch.jit.script instead of trace

- Export CPU version first, then GPU
- Check PyTorch version compatibility

#### Issue: Android model too slow
**Solutions:**
- Use quantized model instead
