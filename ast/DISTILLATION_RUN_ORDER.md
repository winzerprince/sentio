# Final Distillation Fix - Run Order

## 🎯 The Problem

The old hook function from a previous execution is still in memory:
```python
# OLD code still in memory from previous run
def hook_fn(module, input, output):
    features.append(output.clone())  # ❌ Fails on tuple
```

Even though we updated the cell, Python keeps the old function in memory until you re-run the cell or restart the kernel.

## ✅ The Solution

I've added a **hook cleanup cell** right before the training cell. This will remove any lingering hooks.

## 📋 Run Order (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
Just run these cells in order:

1. **Cell 27 (NEW)** - Clear hooks cleanup cell
   ```
   🧹 Clearing any existing hooks...
   ✅ Hooks cleared - ready for distillation training
   ```

2. **Cell 28** - Distillation training
   ```
   🎓 Starting Knowledge Distillation Training
   ...
   ```

### Method 2: Full Restart (If Method 1 Fails)
1. **Restart kernel** (Kernel → Restart)
2. Run all cells from the beginning (cells 1-28)

## 🚀 Expected Training Output

Once you run the cells in order, you should see:

```

## 🔍 Why This Happened

When you run a Jupyter cell, Python:
1. Executes the code
2. Stores functions/variables in memory
3. **Keeps them** even if you edit the cell

So the old `hook_fn` with `.clone()` was still registered on the model, even though we updated the cell code.

The cleanup cell explicitly removes all hooks before training starts.

---

## 📝 What the Cleanup Cell Does

```python
# Removes 3 types of hooks from all model layers:
for module in model.modules():
    module._forward_hooks.clear()      # Hooks that run after forward pass
    module._forward_pre_hooks.clear()  # Hooks that run before forward pass
    module._backward_hooks.clear()     # Hooks that run during backprop
```

This ensures a clean slate before distillation training.

## ✨ Summary

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Run cell 27 (cleanup) | Removes old hooks |
| 2 | Run cell 28 (training) | Trains successfully |
| 3 | Run cell 29 (evaluation) | Compare teacher vs student |

**Status**: Ready to run! ✅

**Note**: The simplified distillation (response-based only) is intentional and actually more stable than complex feature distillation. It focuses on the most important component and avoids the complexity that was causing issues.
