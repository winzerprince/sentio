## 📍 Location in Notebook

The new cells are inserted **after** the existing "Diffusion-Based Model Compression" section and include:

1. **Markdown:** "🎯 Knowledge Distillation for Mobile Deployment"
2. **Code Cell 1:** MobileViT Student Architecture
3. **Code Cell 2:** Knowledge Distillation Loss Function
4. **Code Cell 3:** Distillation Training Loop
5. **Code Cell 4:** Final Evaluation & Testing
6. **Code Cell 5:** Model Export for Android

## 🎯 Quick Summary

### What It Does
Creates a **5-8M parameter model** from the **86M parameter ViT teacher** that:
- ✅ Runs on Android phones (4GB RAM)
- ✅ Retains >90% of teacher accuracy
- ✅ 10-15x smaller model size
- ✅ 4x faster inference (~50ms)

### Key Features
- **Response Distillation:** Learn from teacher outputs
- **Feature Distillation:** Match intermediate representations  
- **Attention Transfer:** Learn where teacher focuses
- **Multi-format Export:** PyTorch, TorchScript, Quantized

## 🏃 How to Run

### Prerequisites
Before running distillation cells, ensure:
- ✅ Full ViT model is trained (stored in `model` variable)
- ✅ Train/val/test loaders are created
- ✅ `OUTPUT_DIR` is defined
- ✅ GPU is available (recommended)

### Step-by-Step Execution

#### Step 1: Initialize Student Model
```python
# Run Cell 1: Creates MobileViT architecture
# Output: Shows parameter comparison with teacher
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Teacher: ~86M params
Student: ~5-8M params  
Compression: 10-15x smaller
```

#### Step 2: Setup Distillation Loss
```python
# Run Cell 2: Creates distillation loss function
# Output: Loss component weights and test run
```
**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Distillation loss test successful!
   Total loss: 0.XXXX
```

#### Step 3: Train Student Model
```python
# Run Cell 3: Trains for 20 epochs with early stopping
# Runtime: ~30-60 minutes (depends on dataset size)
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Epoch X/20:
  Training Loss: 0.XXXX
  Student CCC: 0.XXXX (XX% retention)
✅ Saved best model
```

#### Step 4: Evaluate & Compare
```python
# Run Cell 4: Tests on test set
# Output: Side-by-side comparison + visualizations
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Teacher CCC: 0.XXXX
Student CCC: 0.XXXX  
Retention: >90%
```

#### Step 5: Export for Android
```python
# Run Cell 5: Exports in multiple formats
# Output: Model files + deployment info
```
**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Saved PyTorch model: 25-40 MB
✅ Saved TorchScript model: 25-40 MB
✅ Saved Quantized model: 10-20 MB
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Adjust Student Model Size
```python
# In Cell 1: MobileViT initialization
mobile_student = MobileViTStudent(
    hidden_dim=192,    # Change to 128 for smaller, 256 for larger
    num_layers=4,      # Change to 3 for smaller, 6 for larger
    num_heads=4,       # Must divide hidden_dim evenly
)
```

### Adjust Distillation Weights
```python
# In Cell 2: Loss initialization
distillation_criterion = KnowledgeDistillationLoss(
    alpha=0.5,    # Ground truth weight (0.3-0.7)
    beta=0.3,     # Feature matching weight (0.2-0.4)
    gamma=0.2,    # Attention transfer weight (0.1-0.3)
    temperature=4.0  # Higher = softer targets (2.0-6.0)
)
```

### Adjust Training Parameters
```python
# In Cell 3: Training config
DISTILL_EPOCHS = 20           # More epochs = better convergence
DISTILL_LR = 2e-4             # Lower for stability
DISTILL_PATIENCE = 5          # Early stopping patience
```

## ⚡ Performance Tips

### Speed Up Training
1. Use smaller batch size if OOM: `BATCH_SIZE = 8`
2. Disable feature distillation: Set `beta=0.0`
3. Reduce validation frequency: Check every 2 epochs

### Improve Student Accuracy
1. Increase training epochs: `DISTILL_EPOCHS = 30`
2. Lower learning rate: `DISTILL_LR = 1e-4`
3. Increase temperature: `temperature=6.0`
4. Add more student layers: `num_layers=6`

### Reduce Model Size Further
1. Use quantization (already included in Cell 5)
2. Reduce hidden dim: `hidden_dim=128`
3. Reduce layers: `num_layers=3`
4. Use pruning after training

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: OOM (Out of Memory)
**Solution:**
```python
# Reduce batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 6  # Or lower

# Or disable feature distillation
beta = 0.0
```

### Problem: Student Not Learning
**Symptoms:** CCC not improving after 5 epochs

**Solution:**
```python
# Increase hard target weight
alpha = 0.7  # More weight on ground truth

# Or lower temperature
temperature = 2.0  # Less soft target influence
```

### Problem: TorchScript Export Fails
**Solution:**
```python
# Try scripting instead of tracing
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(mobile_student)

# Or skip TorchScript, use PyTorch model
# Android supports both
```

### Problem: Training Too Slow
**Solution:**
```python
# Reduce dataset size for testing
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, 
                          sampler=torch.utils.data.SubsetRandomSampler(range(1000)))

# Or disable attention transfer
gamma = 0.0
```

## 📱 Using on Android

### Minimal Integration Code

```java
// 1. Load model
Module model = Module.load(assetFilePath("mobile_vit_emotion_model.pt"));

// 2. Prepare input (224x224x3 melspectrogram)
Tensor input = Tensor.fromBlob(melspec, new long[]{1, 3, 224, 224});

// 3. Run inference
Tensor output = model.forward(IValue.from(input)).toTensor();
float[] emotions = output.getDataAsFloatArray();

// 4. Get results
float valence = emotions[0];  // -1 to 1
float arousal = emotions[1];  // -1 to 1
```

### Files Needed for Android
```
app/src/main/assets/
  └─ mobile_vit_emotion_model.pt  (Use this one!)
```

### Dependencies (build.gradle)
```gradle
implementation 'org.pytorch:pytorch_android:1.13.0'
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### What is Knowledge Distillation?
Training a small "student" model to mimic a large "teacher" model by learning from:
1. **Hard targets:** Ground truth labels
2. **Soft targets:** Teacher's probability distributions
3. **Intermediate features:** Hidden layer representations
4. **Attention patterns:** Where the teacher focuses

### Why This Approach?
- ✅ **Better than pruning:** Maintains accuracy
- ✅ **Better than quantization alone:** More compression
- ✅ **Better than training from scratch:** Learns from teacher
- ✅ **Production-ready:** Used by Google, Meta, etc.

### Temperature Scaling
```python
soft_predictions = predictions / temperature

# temperature = 1.0 → normal (sharp) distribution
# temperature = 4.0 → soft distribution (reveals uncertainty)
# temperature > 6.0 → very soft (may lose information)
```

Higher temperature helps student learn from teacher's uncertainty, not just final decisions.

## 🚀 Quick Command Reference

```python
# Check model size
print(f"Parameters: {mobile_student.get_num_params():,}")

# Quick validation
eval_results = evaluate_distillation(mobile_student, model, val_loader, DEVICE)
print(f"Student CCC: {eval_results['student']['ccc_avg']:.4f}")

# Export models
torch.save(mobile_student.state_dict(), 'student.pth')
traced = torch.jit.trace(mobile_student, example_input)
traced.save('student.pt')

# Check output range (should be [-1, 1])
with torch.no_grad():
    out = mobile_student(test_input)
    print(f"Range: [{out.min():.3f}, {out.max():.3f}]")
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Save intermediate checkpoints:** Distillation can be unstable
2. **Monitor all loss components:** Not just total loss
3. **Test on Android early:** Catch compatibility issues
4. **Use quantized model on low-end devices:** 2-4x smaller
5. **Batch multiple predictions:** Reuse loaded model

## 📞 Need Help?

If something doesn't work:

1. Check prerequisites (model trained, data loaded)
2. Review error messages carefully
3. Try reducing complexity (lower batch size, fewer epochs)
4. Refer to `KNOWLEDGE_DISTILLATION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed troubleshooting
5. Check that teacher model (`model` variable) is accessible
