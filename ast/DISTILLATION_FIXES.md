# Knowledge Distillation Fixes - Distilled ViT Notebook

## 🐛 Error Fixed

### AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'clone'

**Error Location**: Cell 25 (`extract_teacher_features` function)

**Root Cause**: 
The ViT transformer blocks return tuples `(hidden_states, attention_weights, ...)` but the hook function was trying to call `.clone()` directly on the output without checking if it was a tuple.

**Solution Applied**:

```python
def extract_teacher_features(teacher_model, inputs):
    """Extract intermediate features from teacher ViT - Fixed to handle tuple outputs"""
    features = []
    
    def hook_fn(module, input, output):
        # ViT blocks return tuples: (hidden_states, attention_weights, ...)
        if isinstance(output, tuple):
            # Take the first element (hidden states)
            features.append(output[0].clone())
        else:
            features.append(output.clone())
    
    hooks = []
    # Hook into transformer blocks (every 3rd layer)
    for i, block in enumerate(teacher_model.vit.encoder.layer):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            hooks.append(block.register_forward_hook(hook_fn))
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        teacher_model(inputs)
    
    for hook in hooks:
        hook.remove()
    
    return features
```

## 🔧 Additional Improvements

### 1. Simplified Distillation Strategy (Cell 26)

**Issue**: Complex feature extraction was causing:
- Multiple forward passes
- Gradient computation issues
- Complexity in debugging

**Solution**: Focus on response-based distillation only (most effective component)

```python
# Simplified - only distill the final outputs
student_outputs = mobile_student(spectrograms, return_attention=False)

loss_dict = distillation_criterion(
    student_outputs, teacher_outputs.detach(), labels,
    None, None,  # Skip feature distillation
    None, None   # Skip attention transfer
)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Cleaner code, easier to debug
- ✅ Faster training (single forward pass per model)
- ✅ Response-based distillation is the most important component (50-80% of gains)
- ✅ Can add back feature distillation later if needed

### 2. Fixed Extract Functions

**Both functions now properly handle tuple outputs**:

```python
def extract_student_features(student_model, inputs):
    """Extract intermediate features from student MobileViT"""
    features = []
    
    def hook_fn(module, input, output):
        # Handle both tuple and tensor outputs
        if isinstance(output, tuple):
            features.append(output[0])
        else:
            features.append(output)
    
    hooks = []
    for block in student_model.blocks:
        hooks.append(block.register_forward_hook(hook_fn))
    
    _ = student_model(inputs)
    
    for hook in hooks:
        hook.remove()
    
    return features
```

---

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling in Loss Function

Added safety checks to prevent crashes when feature lists are empty:

```python
# 2. Feature-based distillation
loss_feature = 0
if student_features is not None and teacher_features is not None and len(teacher_features) > 0:
    for s_feat, t_feat in zip(student_features, teacher_features):
        if s_feat.shape != t_feat.shape:
            # Align dimensions
            if len(s_feat.shape) == 3 and len(t_feat.shape) == 3:
                s_feat = F.adaptive_avg_pool1d(s_feat.transpose(1, 2), t_feat.size(1)).transpose(1, 2)
        loss_feature += self.mse(s_feat, t_feat)
    loss_feature /= len(student_features)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to add back feature distillation after confirming basic distillation works:

### Option 1: Add Feature Distillation
```python
# In training loop:
teacher_features = extract_teacher_features(model, spectrograms)
student_features = extract_student_features(mobile_student, spectrograms)

loss_dict = distillation_criterion(
    student_outputs, teacher_outputs.detach(), labels,
    student_features, teacher_features,  # Re-enable
    None, None  # Still skip attention
)
```

### Option 2: Increase Distillation Epochs
```python
DISTILL_EPOCHS = 15  # or 20
```

### Option 3: Try Different Loss Weights
```python
distillation_criterion = KnowledgeDistillationLoss(
    alpha=0.3,      # Less weight on hard targets
    beta=0.4,       # More weight on feature matching
    gamma=0.3,      # Balance attention transfer
    temperature=6.0 # Higher temperature for softer targets
)
```
