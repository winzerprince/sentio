## Performance Comparison

### Expected Results (Similar)
Both notebooks should achieve comparable performance:

|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Valence CCC** | 0.45 - 0.65 | Higher is better |
| **Arousal CCC** | 0.40 - 0.60 | Higher is better |
| **Test MSE** | 0.10 - 0.20 | Lower is better |
| **Test MAE** | 0.25 - 0.35 | Lower is better |

*Distilled version may achieve slightly better results due to 30 epochs vs 24*

### Memory Footprint

| Stage | Original | Distilled | Difference |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **DEAM Loading** | ~2 GB | ~2 GB | Same |
| **GAN Training** | ~4 GB | ~3.5 GB | -12% |
| **Synthetic Gen** | ~5 GB | ~4 GB | -20% |
| **ViT Training** | ~6 GB | ~5 GB | -17% |
| **Peak Usage** | ~6-7 GB | ~5-6 GB | -15% |

*Distilled version uses less memory due to aggressive cleanup and no intermediate storage*

## Customization Difficulty

### Easy to Modify
Both notebooks:
- Hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate)
- Dataset paths
- Output directories

### Medium Difficulty
- **Original**: Add new visualizations (many examples to follow)
- **Distilled**: Change model architecture (less code to navigate)

### Advanced Modifications
- **Original**: Better for adding experimental features (more scaffolding)
- **Distilled**: Better for production changes (cleaner codebase)

## Which Should You Use?

### Start with **Original** if:
- ❓ You're new to GANs or ViT
- 🎓 You're learning about music emotion recognition
- 🔬 You need to justify design decisions
- 📊 You want extensive quality metrics
- 🐛 You anticipate debugging issues

### Start with **Distilled** if:
- ✅ You understand the pipeline
- ⚡ You need results quickly
- 🏭 You're doing production runs
- 💾 Memory is constrained
- 🔁 You'll run many experiments
- 📦 You want clean, maintainable code

### Use **Both** if:
- 🎓 Learn with Original → Deploy with Distilled
- 🔬 Experiment with Original → Benchmark with Distilled
- 📊 Analyze with Original → Iterate with Distilled

## Migration Path

### From Original to Distilled
1. Copy your hyperparameter changes to Cell 1
2. Skip all optional evaluation cells
3. Increase `VIT_EPOCHS` from 24 to 30
4. Run sequentially

### From Distilled to Original
1. Copy your hyperparameters to Cell 5
2. Enable optional features as needed
3. Add custom visualizations where marked
4. Reduce `VIT_EPOCHS` if needed (24 is sufficient)

## Summary Table

|  | Original | Distilled |
|--|----------|-----------|
| **Learning Curve** | Gentle | Steep |
| **Execution Time** | Longer | Shorter |
| **Code Complexity** | Higher | Lower |
| **Flexibility** | Very High | Medium |
| **Memory Efficiency** | Medium | High |
| **Debugging Ease** | Excellent | Good |
| **Production Ready** | After cleanup | Yes |
| **Best For** | Research & Learning | Deployment & Iteration |
