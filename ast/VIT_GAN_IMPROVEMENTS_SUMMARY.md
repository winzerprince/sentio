# ViT + GAN Model Improvements Summary

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the `vit_with_gans_emotion_prediction.ipynb` notebook based on expert recommendations and best practices for music emotion recognition using Vision Transformers and GANs.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Improvements

### 1. Fixed Critical Error: Missing DataLoader (train_loader)

**Problem:** The training loop was referencing `train_loader` which was never created, causing a `NameError`.

**Solution:** Added a complete dataset preparation section (Section 7) that:
- Combines real and synthetic spectrograms into a single augmented dataset
- Creates a custom `SpectrogramDataset` class with proper ViT preprocessing
- Implements ImageNet-style normalization (mean/std from pretrained ViT)
- Resizes spectrograms to 224x224 (ViT input size)
- Converts grayscale to 3-channel RGB by triplication
- Splits data into train/validation sets (80/20)
- Creates DataLoaders with proper batch size and workers

**Impact:** ‚úÖ Critical - Fixes runtime error and enables training

---

### 2. Enhanced GAN Architecture with Self-Attention

**Problem:** The original GAN generated noisy spectrograms without clear musical structure.

**Solution:** Replaced simple GAN with improved architecture:

#### Improved Generator:
- **Condition Embedding Network**: 2-layer MLP that better encodes valence/arousal
- **Self-Attention Module**: Captures long-range dependencies in spectrograms
- **Progressive Upsampling**: More controlled generation with 4 conv-transpose layers
- **Residual Connections**: In attention module for stable training

#### Improved Discriminator:
- **Spectral Normalization**: Stabilizes training by constraining weight matrices
- **Spatial Condition Embedding**: Embeds emotion labels as spatial maps
- **Dual-Channel Input**: Concatenates spectrogram and condition map
- **No Final Sigmoid**: Uses BCEWithLogitsLoss for numerical stability

**Impact:** üé® High - Generates more realistic, structured spectrograms

---

### 3. Balanced GAN Training Strategy

**Problem:** Discriminator often overpowers generator or vice versa, leading to mode collapse or poor generation.

**Solution:** Implemented adaptive training with multiple safeguards:

#### Adaptive Training Steps:
- Monitors discriminator accuracy on real and fake samples
- **If discriminator too weak** (< 60% accuracy): Trains discriminator more (up to 3 steps)
- **If discriminator too strong** (> 95% accuracy): Trains discriminator less (down to 1 step)
- **Otherwise**: Maintains 1:1 training ratio

#### Training Stability Features:
- **Different Learning Rates**: Generator uses full LR, discriminator uses 0.5x LR
- **Gradient Clipping**: Max norm of 1.0 to prevent exploding gradients
- **BCEWithLogitsLoss**: More numerically stable than BCE + Sigmoid
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Exponential decay (Œ≥=0.99) for both networks

#### Enhanced Monitoring:
- Tracks generator and discriminator losses
- Monitors discriminator accuracy on real/fake samples
- Calculates loss ratio as balance indicator
- Visualizes all metrics in comprehensive plots

**Impact:** ‚öñÔ∏è High - Prevents training instability and mode collapse

---

### 4. Progressive Layer Unfreezing for ViT

**Problem:** Fine-tuning all ViT layers at once can disrupt pretrained features.

**Solution:** Implemented progressive unfreezing strategy:

#### Unfreezing Schedule:
- **Epochs 1-7**: Only regression head trainable (ViT backbone frozen)
- **Epoch 8**: Unfreeze last encoder layer (layer 11)
- **Epoch 12**: Unfreeze last 2 layers (layers 10-11)
- **Epoch 16**: Unfreeze last 3 layers (layers 9-11)

#### Differential Learning Rates:
- **Regression head**: Full learning rate (1e-4)
- **ViT backbone**: 10% of full LR (1e-5)

#### Dynamic Optimizer Updates:
- Optimizer is recreated when new layers are unfrozen
- Learning rate scheduler resets for remaining epochs
- Tracks trainable parameters at each stage

**Impact:** üßä Medium-High - Preserves pretrained features while adapting to audio

---

### 5. Audio Reconstruction with Griffin-Lim

**Problem:** No way to qualitatively assess GAN output by listening to generated audio.

**Solution:** Implemented complete audio reconstruction pipeline:

#### Spectrogram-to-Audio Conversion:
- **Griffin-Lim Algorithm**: Phase reconstruction from magnitude spectrogram
- **Inverse Mel Transform**: Converts mel spectrogram back to linear STFT
- **Denormalization**: Reverses normalization applied during preprocessing
- **32 Iterations**: High-quality phase estimation

#### Sample Generation and Playback:
- Generates spectrograms for specific emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- Converts to audio using Griffin-Lim
- Saves as .wav files with emotion labels in filename
- Displays interactive audio players in notebook
- Visualizes corresponding spectrograms

#### Test Emotions:
1. Sad & Calm (V: -0.8, A: -0.6)
2. Happy & Energetic (V: 0.8, A: 0.7)
3. Angry & Tense (V: -0.3, A: 0.8)
4. Content & Relaxed (V: 0.5, A: -0.5)
5. Neutral (V: 0.0, A: 0.0)

**Impact:** üéß Medium - Enables qualitative evaluation of generation quality

---

### 6. Weighted Emotion Loss Function

**Problem:** MSE treats valence and arousal equally, but they may have different importance.

**Solution:** Implemented `WeightedEmotionLoss`:

```python
class WeightedEmotionLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, valence_weight=0.6, arousal_weight=0.4):
        # Valence: 60%, Arousal: 40%
```

#### Benefits:
- Allows prioritizing valence (often more important in music emotion)
- Can be adjusted based on validation performance
- More flexible than simple MSE
- Easy to tune for dataset characteristics

**Impact:** ‚öñÔ∏è Medium - Improved prediction accuracy on key emotion dimension

---

### 7. GAN Quality Metrics (FID-Style Evaluation)

**Problem:** No quantitative way to measure if GAN generates realistic spectrograms.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive quality evaluation:

#### Metrics Computed:
1. **Fr√©chet Distance**: Measures distribution similarity (lower is better)
2. **Statistical Moments**: Compares mean and standard deviation
3. **Temporal Smoothness**: Detects excessive noise via frame-to-frame variation
4. **Frequency Correlation**: Measures similarity of frequency profiles
5. **Dynamic Range**: Compares amplitude ranges

#### Composite Quality Score (0-100):
- **70-100**: Excellent - High-quality spectrograms
- **50-69**: Good - Acceptable but improvable
- **0-49**: Poor - Mostly noise, needs improvement

#### Visualizations:
- Side-by-side real vs synthetic spectrograms
- Frequency profile comparisons
- Amplitude distribution histograms
- Temporal evolution plots
- Quality metrics bar chart

**Impact:** üìä High - Objective measurement of GAN generation quality

---

### 8. Additional Training Enhancements

#### Mixed Precision Training:
- Uses `torch.cuda.amp` for faster training on GPU
- Automatic gradient scaling to prevent underflow
- ~2x speedup on modern GPUs

#### Gradient Clipping:
- Max norm of 1.0 for all models (ViT, Generator, Discriminator)
- Prevents exploding gradients
- Improves training stability

#### Early Stopping:
- Monitors validation loss
- Stops training if no improvement for 5 epochs
- Saves best model checkpoint
- Prevents overfitting

#### Learning Rate Scheduling:
- Cosine annealing for smooth LR decay
- Minimum LR of 1e-6 to avoid stalling
- Warm restarts when unfreezing new layers

**Impact:** üöÄ Medium - Faster, more stable training

---

## üìû Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **OOM (Out of Memory)**: Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` from 16 to 8
2. **GAN instability**: Increase `GAN_EPOCHS` from 10 to 15
3. **Poor ViT performance**: Check if model loaded correctly (check for "random initialization" warning)
4. **Audio sounds bad**: This is expected - GAN spectrograms are approximations
5. **Training too slow**: Ensure GPU is enabled in Kaggle settings

Good luck with your music emotion recognition project! üéµüé®ü§ñ
