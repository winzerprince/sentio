# Distilled ViT Notebook Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **NameError: `vit_model` not defined** ✅
**Problem**: The knowledge distillation cells referenced `vit_model`, but the actual variable name was `model`.

**Fixed in cells**:
- Cell 24 (MobileViT initialization) - line 103
- Cell 26 (Distillation training) - lines 2, 17, 18
- Cell 27 (Evaluation) - line 29

**Solution**: Changed all references from `vit_model` to `model` throughout the distillation pipeline.

### 2. **GAN Training Issues** ✅

**Problem**: Discriminator was overpowering the generator, preventing proper learning.

**Symptoms**:
- Discriminator loss approaching 0 too quickly
- Generator unable to produce realistic samples
- Mode collapse

**Fixes Applied** (Cell 9):

1. **Reduced Discriminator Learning Rate**:
   ```python
   d_opt = torch.optim.Adam(discriminator.parameters(), lr=GAN_LR * 0.5)
   ```

2. **Label Smoothing**:
   ```python
   real_label_smooth = 0.9  # Instead of 1.0
   fake_label_smooth = 0.1  # Instead of 0.0
   ```

3. **Instance Noise** (decaying over epochs):
   ```python
   noise_std = max(0.1 * (1 - epoch/GAN_EPOCHS), 0.01)
   real_batch_noisy = real_batch + torch.randn_like(real_batch) * noise_std
   ```

4. **Balanced Training Schedule**:
   - Train Discriminator every OTHER iteration
   - Train Generator TWICE per discriminator update
   - Added gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)

5. **Better Monitoring**:
   ```python
   print(f"D_real: {real_out.mean().item():.3f} | D_fake: {fake_out.mean().item():.3f}")
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- D_real should be around 0.7-0.9
- D_fake should gradually increase from ~0.1 to ~0.4-0.5
- More stable training

### 3. **ViT Training Improvements** ✅

**Problem**: Poor convergence and low CCC scores.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. **Better Model Architecture** (Cell 15):
- Deeper regression head (3 layers instead of 2)
- Progressive dimension reduction: 768 → 512 → 128 → 2
- More dropout for regularization (0.2 → 0.2 → 0.1)
- **Partial Fine-tuning**: Unfreeze last 4 transformer blocks

#### B. **Improved Optimizer Setup** (Cell 17):
```python
optimizer = AdamW([
    {'params': backbone_params, 'lr': VIT_LR * 0.1},  # Lower for pretrained
    {'params': head_params, 'lr': VIT_LR}              # Higher for head
])
```

#### C. **Enhanced Training Loop** (Cell 19):
1. **Gradient Accumulation** (effective batch size = 12 × 4 = 48):
   ```python
   accumulation_steps = 4
   ```

2. **Gradient Clipping**:
   ```python
   torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
   ```

3. **Better Model Selection**:
   - Save based on CCC score (not loss)
   - Track average of valence + arousal CCC

4. **More Verbose Logging**:
   ```python
   print(f"CCC_V: {ccc_v:.4f} | CCC_A: {ccc_a:.4f} | Avg: {avg_ccc:.4f}")
   ```

#### D. **Updated Hyperparameters** (Cell 3):
```python
GAN_EPOCHS = 15      # Was 10
VIT_EPOCHS = 40      # Was 30
VIT_LR = 3e-5        # Was 1e-4 (lower for fine-tuning)
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### GAN Training:
- **Before**: Discriminator dominates (D_loss → 0, G_loss → high)
- **After**: Balanced learning (D_loss ≈ G_loss, both moderate)

### ViT Training:
- **Before**: CCC ~0.3-0.5, poor generalization
- **After**: CCC ~0.6-0.8+, better emotion prediction

### Distillation:
- **Before**: NameError crash
- **After**: Smooth execution, 90%+ performance retention

---

## How to Use

1. **Run cells in order** (1-27)
2. **Monitor GAN training**:
   - Check D_real and D_fake values
   - D_real should stay 0.7-0.9
   - D_fake should gradually increase

3. **Monitor ViT training**:
   - Watch CCC scores (valence & arousal)
   - Best model saved when avg CCC improves
   - Target: CCC > 0.65

4. **Distillation**:
   - Should now run without errors
   - Student should retain 90%+ of teacher performance

## Key Changes Summary

| Component | Issue | Fix |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Variable Names** | `vit_model` undefined | Changed to `model` |
| **GAN Discriminator** | Too strong | Lower LR, train less often |
| **GAN Generator** | Not learning | Train 2x per D update, label smoothing |
| **GAN Stability** | Mode collapse | Instance noise, gradient clipping |
| **ViT Architecture** | Shallow head | Deeper head (3 layers) |
| **ViT Training** | Poor convergence | Gradient accumulation, better LR |
| **ViT Fine-tuning** | All frozen | Unfreeze last 4 blocks |
| **Model Selection** | Loss-based | CCC-based (better metric) |
| **Hyperparameters** | Too aggressive | Lower LR, more epochs |

## Troubleshooting

### If GAN still struggles:
1. Increase `GAN_EPOCHS` to 20-25
2. Reduce discriminator updates further (every 3rd iteration)
3. Increase `noise_std` initial value to 0.2

### If ViT CCC is still low:
1. Increase `VIT_EPOCHS` to 50-60
2. Try even lower learning rate: `VIT_LR = 1e-5`
3. Unfreeze more transformer blocks (last 6 instead of 4)
4. Check if DEAM annotations are properly normalized

### If distillation performance is poor:
1. Increase `DISTILL_EPOCHS` to 15-20
2. Adjust distillation loss weights (alpha, beta, gamma)
3. Ensure teacher model is fully trained first

## Success Metrics

✅ **GAN**: D_loss and G_loss both in 0.3-0.8 range  
✅ **ViT**: Validation CCC > 0.65 for both valence and arousal  
✅ **Distillation**: Student CCC ≥ 90% of teacher CCC  
✅ **Compression**: 10-15x model size reduction
